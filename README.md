## Running the project locally

Prerequisities: xampp (https://www.apachefriends.org/pl/download.html) and composer (https://getcomposer.org/download/) installed, Laravel version 8 (https://laravel.com/docs/8.x).

To run the project on the local server, follow the steps below (or see: https://devmarketer.io/learn/setup-laravel-project-cloned-github-com/):
- Launch Apache server and MySQL in xampp.
- Create the database named 'laravel-crud' (or any other name you like) in the PhPMyAdmin Panel from xampp.
- Clone the repo to the htdocs folder of xampp.
- Open the repo in the code editor which provides terminal dealing with php artisan commands (I used Visual Studio Code for this purpose).
- Run 'composer install' command in the terminal (bash mode in VS Code).
- Run 'npm install' command in the terminal (bash mode in VS Code).
- Run 'cp .env.example .env' command in the terminal (bash mode in VS Code).
- In the just created .env file change the line 'DB_DATABASE=laravel' to 'DB_DATABASE=laravel-crud'.
- Run 'php artisan key:generate' command in the terminal (bash mode in VS Code).
- Run 'php artisan migrate:refresh --seed' command in the terminal (bash mode in VS Code) to seed the static data.
- The application shall be avaible at http://localhost/laravel-authentication-crud-many-to-many/public/.
- To login as administrator use the following static test credentials: E-Mail Address: admin@gmail.com, Password: admin.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
